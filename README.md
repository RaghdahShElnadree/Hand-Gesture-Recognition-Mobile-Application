# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Mobile-Application
Wireless devices play an important role in our life . Mobile phones can be used to help people to overcome their problems that face them every day, every where. Here it intended to enable deaf mutes to communicate smoothly and easily with their communities.

With the development of software operated hand held devices, hand gesture recognition became a new hope for this group of people to communicate among themselves or with other people. However device based measurement which measures hand gestures with equipment such as data gloves which can archive the accurate positions of hand gestures as its positions are directly measured. Secondly, vision-based technique which can cover hands signer in which signer does not need to wear data gloves device.
